molecular_surface_demo_tool
===========================

Demo application to show the Connolly surface and Skin surface

You'll need the following libraries to compile the viewer:
* boost (shared pointers)
* Qt (User interface)
* CGAL (Triangulation + Skin surface mesher)

The following two libraries are only needed for the surface viewer,
not for the curve viewer:
* ESBTL (Loading pdb files)
* OpenSceneGraph (Rendering of the skin surface viewer)
